# ToDo Challange

## Overview

The basic idea is to take your Matplotlibplayground script, and alter it to use actual data.

## Some helpful notes

It'll probably help to use python's `open('file')`, the datetime module, and some basic array manipulation.

Your final program will have to work for all of the different ways the data is written. (Make sure to closely read all of the files contained in the `/data/` folder. Pay special note to "ToDo" items with multiple lines, spacing, etc.)

Best of luck, this is expected to take a few hours at your level, so do it over multiple days.
